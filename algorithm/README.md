Purpose: For this folder, we mainly practise the algorithm using python.

File List:
    1.calculate_square_area.py --> This is the file to demonstrate how to 
  calculate the area of a square.
  (area_of_square.png is the picture of several results of working
  calculate_square_area.py)

    2.sum_from_num_to_10.py --> This is the file to demonstrate how to
  calculate the summation from a number smaller than 10 to 10.
  (sum_from_num_to_10.png is the image of how sum_from_num_to_10.py
  works.)

    3.file_write.py --> This is the file to demonstrate how to create a 
  file and add sentences in it.
  (file_write.mp4 is a short video of how the code works.)
   
    4.list_prime.py --> This is the file to demonstrate how to calculate
  all the prime numbers before a positive number and make them into a list.
  (list_prime.mp4 is a short video of how the code works.)

    5.sum_of_prime.py -->This is the file to demonstrate how to calculate 
  the sum of three prime numbers after a number 
  (the sum_of_prime.png is a image that shows several results of how the code
  works and besides each one is the process of calculation I wrote)
